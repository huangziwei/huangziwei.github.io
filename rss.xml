                        I encountered the John Doe theme a while ago and wanted to revamp my online CV with
                        it. I've finally managed to do so today, with some modifications&lt;label for="revamped-note-1"&gt;1&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input id="revamped-note-1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;small&gt;I added some CSS and JS to animate the home page and to enable anchoring on all
                            IDs, not just the navigation. As much as I'd like to avoid using JS, I've come to
                            understand that it's a necessary evil for better UX.&lt;/small&gt;. Now, everything is in a single-page HTML file, less than 3 KB at the
                        moment—isn't that nice? A TXT of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice on Project
                        Gutenberg is just 708 kB, and it loads instantly on any browser. So why should my site
                        be slower than that? And I certainly don't have that many words to say these days. But
                        when I do, I absolutely love the
                        &lt;span style="
                                background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet);
                                -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
                                -webkit-background-clip: text;
                                background-clip: text;
                            "&gt;flexibility&lt;/span&gt;
                        of hand-written HTML.
